## Pinned messages

A bot can 'pin' messages sent to supergroups and channels if it has the appropriate rights there.
To 'pin' a message, add a separate line to the message body.

```
###pin
```

This line will be removed from the published message, and the message itself will be 'pinned' in the target channel/supergroup.
