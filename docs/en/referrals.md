# EmailGateBot referral program

With EmailGateBot `/referrals` command, you can participate in the bot's referral program.
Members of the program can earn internal EmailGateBot coins by referring new bot's users to purchase internal EmailGateBot coins.

The command `/referrals` shows the bot user his own unique referral link like `http://t.me/EmailGateBot?Start=utm_XXXXX`.
Each new bot user who launches EmailGateBot for the first time using such a link receives 1 EmailGateBot coin to his account as a bonus and is remembered as a referral of the link owner.

In the menu of `/referrals` command, the link owner can get a list of all his referrals in the form of a csv file in utf-8 encoding and set up notifications about new referrals connections.

The owner of the link can add his own data to it after the '_' symbol to track the site where he is posting the link.

For instance:

```
http://t.me/EmailGateBot?start=utm_XXXX_youtube
http://t.me/EmailGateBot?start=utm_XXXX_instagram
```

The overall length of your code plus your data cannot exceed 64 characters. Only `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -` are allowed.

For every 10 coins bought by his referrals, the owner of the link receives 1 coin to his account.

In the menu of `/referrals` command, the link owner can get a list of referrals purchases in the form of a csv file in utf-8 encoding and set up notifications about such purchases.

The coins earned in the referral program can be used for the [paid functions](paid_and_free.md) of EmailGateBot.

If a lot of EmailGateBot coins have accumulated on the account, they can be exchanged for real money in a package of 500 coins at the rate of $0.25 USD for one EmailGateBot coin.
