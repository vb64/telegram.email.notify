# Pictures, videos, stickers and other types of media in EmailGateBot

You can publish images by attaching an image file to the email you send.
The first 1024 bytes of the text of the letter will be used as a caption for the picture.
During the day in this way, you can post no more than 120 pictures.
The limit is reset every day at 00:00 GMT.
[Mass mailing](bulk.md) to several chats via `post@telegram-email.appspotmail.com` is counted as one picture.

Also, you can publish pictures and files of any type in another way.
Send the file to the private chat with a bot.
The bot will respond to you with a message that contains a special code.
This code should be added as a separate line in the text of the email and your file will be published.

You can send files of the following types: 

- audio
- animation
- photo
- sticker
- video
- voice
- video message
- and regular file (document)

Files and images sent in this way are not counted for the daily quota of sent pictures.

If you send an email containing the code and the attached image file, the attached image file will be published, but the code will be ignored.
